# GitHub Skills Introduction

This repository contains learning materials and hands-on exercises to teach fundamental GitHub concepts and workflows.

## Why Learn GitHub?

GitHub is one of the most widely used platforms for software development and collaboration. By understanding basic tools like repositories, branches, commits and pull requests, you'll be able to:

- Contribute to open source projects 
- Manage personal and professional codebases
- Develop software efficiently within a team
- Store and share your work with others

## Course Overview

The course is delivered through guided instructions and explanations in the `README.md` file. Key topics include:

- Version control and Git/GitHub basics
- Repository structure and collaboration model  
- The development workflow of branching, committing and pull requests
- Finding and contributing to open source projects
- Additional learning resources for diving deeper

## Repository Contents

- `README.md` - Main course material and activity instructions
- `commands` folder - Examples of common Git commands  
- `images` folder - Images used for the course
- Metadata files (`.gitignore`, `LICENSE`)
## Commands Folder

The `commands` folder contains example files to demonstrate GitHub CLI (command line) commands:

- `add.md` - Demonstrates `git add` to stage changes
- `commit.md` - Demonstrates `git commit` to commit changes
- `push.md` - Demonstrates `git push` to push commits to a remote repository  
- `pull.md` - Demonstrates `git pull` to pull changes from a remote repository


## Completing Exercises

Follow the steps in `README.md` to practice setting up a local clone, forking, branching and contributing changes through pull requests. At the specified point:

1. Checkout a new branch for your changes (e.g. `your-name`)
2. Modify a file like `README.md` and commit 
3. Open a pull request to propose and discuss your changes
4. Merge the pull request to complete the exercise

Here's a recap of your accomplishments:

- You learned about GitHub, repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests.
- You created a branch, a commit, and a pull request.
- You merged a pull request.
- You made your first contribution! :tada:

### What's next?

If you'd like to make a profile README, use the quickstart instructions below or follow the instructions in the [Managing your profile README](https://docs.github.com/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) article.

1. Make a new public repository with a name that matches your GitHub username.
2. Create a file named `README.md` in its root. The "root" means not inside any folder in your repository.
3. Edit the contents of the `README.md` file.
4. If you created a new branch for your file, open and merge a pull request on your branch.
